# Title
From Coding to Creativity: Using Dancing Sphero Robots to Inspire STEM Learning

# Description
We are using Sphero to teach programming fundamentals (for functions, variables, etc.) in a hands on way. We focused on
exploring the intersection between robotics and the arts (more specifically -dance). The students will navigate Sphero by creating a
brief dance code using the avaiable functions and varibles provided on the app to move the robot. TAP is the technology ambassadors
program that allows students to learn leadership skills and help promote IT and STEM careers. [Link to TAP GGC](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/schools/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program/)

# Installation/setup
* A Sphero
* A device (laptop/tablet/phone) with Bluetooth connectivity 

# Usage
* Connect the Sphero robot via Bluetooth with the device in order to move it.
* Using the Sphero edu coding environment, build a program with block code.
* Execute the program to see the Sphero move.
